# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Transfer Learning

## Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using transfer learning. The model is trained on a pre-existing deep learning architecture, leveraging the knowledge gained from a source task to improve the learning of the target task.

## Features

- Transfer learning with a pre-trained neural network for improved accuracy.
- Dataset used: [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- Python-based implementation using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Additional dependencies (list them if necessary)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eshwargajula/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition.git
   cd Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
